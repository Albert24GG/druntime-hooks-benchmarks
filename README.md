# druntime-hooks-benchmarks
Framework for benchmarking [DRuntime](https://github.com/dlang/druntime/) hooks and compairing their performance before and after being converted to templates.

## Reason
Converting DRuntime hooks to templates is one of the community's [stated objectives](https://github.com/dlang/projects/issues/25).
This project was picked up [almost 3 years ago](https://github.com/Vild/GSOC2019/) and now I wish to continue it.
In addition, translating DRuntime into a template library, will make D more viable for embedded systems, following the results of [this](https://github.com/dlang/projects/issues/69) project.
